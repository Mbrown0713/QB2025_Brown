Student QB repo for Madison Brown
Madison Brown mbr6@iu.edu

I am a first-year graduate student from Covington, GA. It is a suburb about 30 minutes east of Atlanta and is famously known for the large amount of movie and TV filming done there. I graduated from the University of Georgia in May 2024 where I majored in Avian Biology and had minors in ecology, entomology, and biology. Following graduate school I think I would like to work with the Fish and Wildlife Services or the Department of Natural Resources. 

In this course I am hoping to become more comfortable with coding, to learn helpful techniques when analyzing biodiversity in an area, and to hopefully learn some techniques that will be helpful when writing my thesis.
